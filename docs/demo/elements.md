## Numbering

This sections uses the {rst:role}`num` role to create numbered sub-sections that
reference each other with the {rst:role}`numref` role, and separately numbered
unreferenced quotes.

### Exercise {num}`ex:first`

Read these quotes, then move on to exercises {numref}`ex:second` &
{numref}`ex:third`.

{attribution="Terry Pratchett, Mort"}
> **Quote {num}`quote`:** "It would seem that you have no useful skill or talent
> whatsoever," he said. "Have you thought of going into teaching?""

{attribution="Terry Pratchett, Hogfather"}
> **Quote {num}`quote`:** Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every
> time.

### Exercise {num}`ex:second`

You've already read the quotes from {numref}`exercise %s<ex:first>`. Read this
one as well, then go to {numref}`exercise %s<ex:third>`.

{attribution="Douglas Adams, The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy"}
> **Quote {num}`quote`:** For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second
> or so, nothing continued to happen.

### Exercise {num}`ex:third`

This is the last quote.

{attribution="Iain M. Banks, Consider Phlebas"}
> **Quote {num}`quote`:** I had nightmares I thought were really horrible until
> I woke up and remembered what reality was at the moment.

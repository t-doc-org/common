# Elements

## Document metadata

This section configures page metadata with a {rst:dir}`metadata` directive to
hide solutions by default.

```{metadata}
hide-solutions: true
```

## Solutions

This section has several {rst:dir}`solution` blocks, and the page is
configured to hide solutions by default. Click the "Toggle solutions" button in
the navbar to show or hide them.

```{solution}
This solution follows the per-page setting.
```

```{solution} *Complete* solution
This solution has a custom title.
```

```{solution} Solution (show)
:show:
This solution is always visible.
```

```{solution} Solution (expand)
:expand:
This solution is expanded by default.
```

```{solution}
:class: warning

```

## Quizzes

The helpers in the
[`quizz.js`](https://github.com/t-doc-org/common/blob/main/tdoc/common/static/tdoc/quizz.js)
module enable the creation of quizzes as dynamic page elements.

<script>
async function question(prompt, want) {
  const node = document.currentScript;
  const core = await tdoc.import('tdoc/core.js');
  const quizz = await tdoc.import('tdoc/quizz.js');
  await core.typesetMath(quizz.question(node, prompt, resp => {
    if (resp === want) return true;
    return core.html(
      `The solution is <em>probably</em> "${want}". Maybe. I'm not sure.`);
  }));
}
</script>

1.  <script>
    const value = Math.floor(256 * Math.random());
    question(
      `Convert \\(${value.toString(2).padStart(8, '0')}_2\\) to decimal.`,
      value.toString());
    </script>
2.  <script>
    question(`\
    What is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and \
    everything? Explain your reasoning in full detail, provide references, and \
    indicate plausible alternatives.`, '42');
    </script>
3.  The input field of quizz questions without a prompt uses the whole line.
    <script>question(undefined, "cool");</script>

## IFrames

## Numbering

This sections uses the {rst:role}`num` role to create numbered sub-sections that
reference each other with the {rst:role}`numref` role, and separately numbered
unreferenced quotes.

### Exercise {num}`ex:first`

Read these quotes, then move on to exercises {numref}`ex:second` &
{numref}`ex:third`.

{attribution="Terry Pratchett, Mort"}
> **Quote {num}`quote`:** "It would seem that you have no useful skill or talent
> whatsoever," he said. "Have you thought of going into teaching?""

{attribution="Terry Pratchett, Hogfather"}
> **Quote {num}`quote`:** Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every
> time.

### Exercise {num}`ex:second`

You've already read the quotes from {numref}`exercise %s<ex:first>`. Read this
one as well, the move to {numref}`exercise %s<ex:third>`.

{attribution="Douglas Adams, The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy"}
> **Quote {num}`quote`:** For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second
> or so, nothing continued to happen.

### Exercise {num}`ex:third`

This is the last quote.

{attribution="Iain M. Banks, Consider Phlebas"}
> **Quote {num}`quote`:** I had nightmares I thought were really horrible until
> I woke up and remembered what reality was at the moment.

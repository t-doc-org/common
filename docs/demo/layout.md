    dog.
4.  Describe the main components of a computer.

## Numbering & points

This sections uses the {rst:role}`num` role to create numbered sub-sections that
reference each other with the {rst:role}`numref` role, and separately numbered
unreferenced quotes using {rst:role}`nump`. It also assigns points to each
sub-section with the {rst:role}`points` role, and displays a points table at the
top.

<style>
table.points > thead > tr > th {
  min-width: 3rem;
}
</style>

```{flex-table}
:class: points grid align-left
{t=h}|{.l}Exercise    |{points=label}|Total
{t=b}|{t=h .l}Points  |{points=value}|{points=sum}
     |{t=h .l}Obtained|{points=empty}|
```

### Exercise {num}`ex:first`{points}`2.5`

Read these quotes, then move on to exercises {numref}`ex:second` &
{numref}`ex:third`.

> **Quote {nump}`quote`:** "It would seem that you have no useful skill or talent
> whatsoever," he said. "Have you thought of going into teaching?""

{attribution="Terry Pratchett, Hogfather"}
> **Quote {nump}`quote`:** Real stupidity beats artificial intelligence every
> time.

### Exercise {num}`ex:second`{points}`1`

You've already read the quotes from {numref}`exercise %s<ex:first>`. Read this
one as well, then go to {numref}`exercise %s<ex:third>`.

> **Quote {nump}`quote`:** For a moment, nothing happened. Then, after a second

### Exercise {num}`ex:third`{points}`2`

This is the last quote.

{attribution="Iain M. Banks, Consider Phlebas"}
> **Quote {nump}`quote`:** I had nightmares I thought were really horrible until
> I woke up and remembered what reality was at the moment.

### Bonus {num}`bonus`{points}`1!:B{0}`

{attribution="Martha Wells, Network Effect"}
> **Quote {nump}`quote`:** "Can I ask you a question?" I never know how to

### Bonus {num}`bonus`{points}`0.5!:B{0}`

{attribution="Neal Stephenson, Anathem"}
> **Quote {nump}`quote`:** Technically, of course, he was right. Socially, he

## Grid layouts

The {rst:dir}`list-grid` below creates a 2-column layout. A heading is used to
label the columns.

```{list-grid}
:style: grid-template-columns: 5fr 3fr;
- # Cell 1
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
  eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad
  minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip
  ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in
  voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur

  deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
- # Cell 2
  |Key|Value|
  |:-:|:---:|
  |a|1|
  |b|2|
  |c|3|
```

## Blocks

The sections below define exercises where the solutions are defined next to
their exercise in the source document using {rst:dir}`block` directives, and
grouped together at the bottom with a {rst:dir}`blocks` directive. The exercises
are numbered with the {rst:role}`num` role.

### Exercises

#### Exercise {num}`block-ex:a`

This is exercise {numref}`block-ex:a`.

```{block} solution
This is the solution to exercise {numref}`block-ex:a`.
```

#### Exercise {num}`block-ex:b`

This is exercise {numref}`block-ex:b`.

```{block} solution
This is the solution to exercise {numref}`block-ex:b`.
```

#### Exercise {num}`block-ex:c`

This is exercise {numref}`block-ex:c`.

```{block} solution
This is the solution to exercise {numref}`block-ex:c`.
